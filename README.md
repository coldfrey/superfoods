## About the Project

### Executive Summary

**SuperFoods** is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between superyacht kitchens and the suppliers they need. Think of it as a bespoke delivery service for wholesale superyachts, operating seamlessly from port to port. The platform caters to both buyers (chefs and procurement officers) and suppliers, allowing for effortless sign-up and interaction. This dual approach not only provides buyers with a wider array of options—especially in unfamiliar ports—but also offers suppliers access to a market they might not have reached otherwise.

### Platform Overview

#### For Buyers (Chefs/Procurement Officers)

- **Intuitive Home Page**: Features two primary tabs—a list view of suppliers and a map view for geographical reference.
- **Supplier Profiles**: Access detailed commercial profiles, including catalogs, reviews, ratings, and images, similar to Google Maps listings. Suppliers can attain a 'verified' status to enhance their credibility.
- **Account Management**: Easily view past orders, account summaries, and communicate directly with suppliers.
- **Flexible Checkout Options**: Choose to pay immediately, upon collection, or via invoice, depending on supplier preferences.
- **Advanced Super Search**: Utilize robust search capabilities to find specific food items and identify suppliers who can fulfill those requests.
- **Customizable Filters**: Narrow down suppliers based on distance, tags (e.g., organic, free-range), average review ratings, and more.

#### For Suppliers

- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**: Monitor messages, incoming orders, fulfilled orders, and key sales metrics.
- **Profile and Catalog Management**: Update settings and preferences that influence search visibility and filtering; respond to reviews and public inquiries.
- **Market Insights**: Access a map to browse local competition and other suppliers in the vicinity.

### Use Case: Superyacht Chef

As the chef on a 30m privately-owned superyacht, I am responsible for ordering and ensuring we have all the necessary food and supplies on board. After cruising for two weeks, we need to restock fresh provisions and are docking at an unfamiliar port. I open the **SuperFoods** app/website and effortlessly search for wholesale food suppliers within a 100-mile radius who can deliver directly to the marina. Simultaneously, I find a local farm offering fresh, organic meat. I select these top-rated suppliers based on my filter criteria (e.g., organic, delivery available). Browsing their catalogs, I place my orders and make payments through the platform. The next morning, the deliveries arrive seamlessly. I leave positive reviews to help other vessels trust these suppliers in the future.

### Key Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the procurement process, saving time and reducing hassle.
- **Variety**: Provides access to a broader range of suppliers, including local businesses, enhancing culinary options on board.
- **Trust and Transparency**: Features like reviews, ratings, and 'verified' supplier status build trust between buyers and suppliers.
- **Support for Local Economies**: Encourages sourcing from local suppliers, benefiting regional businesses.

### Unique Selling Points

- **Tailored for Superyachts**: Specifically designed to meet the unique needs of superyacht kitchens, unlike generic delivery services.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Sophisticated tools to find exactly what is needed, even in unfamiliar locations.
